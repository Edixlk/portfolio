# About me  (draft#1)


My name is josh and I am 18 years old, living in the Caribbean. I first stumbled upon web development back in 2022 and HTML was the very first thing I came across (out of boredom).
My passion grew for  web development when my group won for the best looking website for a Easter hackathon (I know it's not actual hacking). Fast forward to a year or two later, I've been _slowly_ making progress on mastering CSS, JavaScript and a bit more of HTML. Despite having very little time and living in a not so good environment, I still make attempts to keep myself together and continue learning mostly the frontend side of things in web development. Slow progress is better than no progress.

My Goal is to create simple, fully functional and visually pleasing websites at a affordable or reasonable price, nothing too complicated.
